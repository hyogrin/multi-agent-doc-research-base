  ----- Contexts -----
  {contexts}

  ----- Your Task -----
  Extract key information from contexts above:
  1. Identify main insights with supporting evidence
  2. Note important statistics and examples
  3. Track sources (URLs, titles) for citations
  4. Focus ONLY on provided information

  ----- Output JSON -----
  {{
    "key_insights": [
      {{"insight": "<finding>", "evidence": "<quote>", "source": "<URL>"}}
    ],
    "data_points": [
      {{"type": "statistic|example", "description": "<detail>", "source": "<URL>"}}
    ],
    "sources": [
      {{"source": "<URL/file name>", "title": "<title>", "relevance": "<why important>"}}
    ],
    "gaps": ["<missing info>"],
    "writer_notes": "<guidance for writer>"
  }}

  Rules:
  - Output ONLY valid JSON
  - Use double quotes
  - No trailing commas
  - Extract URLs/file names from contexts (look for "Source: https://...", "*.pdf")
  - If no clear JSON structure is feasible, simplify to: {{"summary": "<text>", "sources": []}}
